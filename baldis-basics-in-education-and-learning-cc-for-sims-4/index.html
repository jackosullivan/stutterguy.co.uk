                <p>“Oh hi! Welcome to my Schoolhouse.”</p>

                <p>This is a single item that is found in the full body section.</p>
				
                <p>As the model for Baldi is very basic, some distortion may occur when he moves or performs certain actions.</p>
				
				<p>Once your sim is wearing the Baldi outfit, their teeth will be floating in front of his head. Be sure to download the <a href="https://stutterguy.co.uk/no-teeth-mod-for-the-sims-4/">No Teeth Mod</a> to remove the teeth.</p>
