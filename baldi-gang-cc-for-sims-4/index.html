                <p>“Wow! That’s great! Let’s play again, sometime soon.”</p>

                <p>This bundle contains five items for four characters.</p>
				
				<h4>Playtime</h4>
				
				<ul>
					<li>A full body outfit</li>
					<li>Scribble eyes</li>
				</ul>

                <p>Whilst I wanted to make Playtime a 2D character, it felt like I was just stealing artwork from <a href="https://twitter.com/mystman12">Mystman12</a> instead of creating my own resources. Also, I tried several methods for recreating the hair which either didn’t work or looked atrocious, so the hair and the shoes used in the preview image are from expansion packs.</p>
				
				<h4>Gotta Sweep</h4>
				
				<p>Gotta Sweep is a single item found in the full body section for adults. Be sure to download the <a href="https://stutterguy.co.uk/no-teeth-mod-for-the-sims-4/">No Teeth mod</a> to remove his teeth.</p>
				
				<h4>1st Prize</h4>
				
				<p>1st Prize is a single item found in the full body section for kids. I wasn’t able to rig him so that he just glided along the floor smoothly, so we can pretend one of his wires has been cut. Be sure to download the <a href="https://stutterguy.co.uk/no-teeth-mod-for-the-sims-4/">No Teeth mod</a> for kids to remove his teeth (they’re hid inside his head, but sometimes they pop out).</p>
				
				<h4>Arts and Crafters</h4>
				
				<p>Arts and Crafters is a single item found in the full body section for adults.</p>
				
				<h4>“Where’s Principal of the Thing and It’s a Bully?”</h4>
				
				<p>Principle of the Thing can be made using items that are already in the game, as can It’s a Bully. This little project only started to make a dress for Playtime as nothing similar existed in the game. Again, the reason I decided not to make Principal or the Thing is because I didn’t want to make a 2D character that is just stolen artwork.</p>
