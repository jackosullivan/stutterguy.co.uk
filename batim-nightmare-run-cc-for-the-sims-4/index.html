                <p>The chase is on!</p>

                <p>This download contains 4 items, each one is found in the full body section in CAS.</p>

                <p>As the models are large and somewhat non-humanoid, some clipping issues may occur. This includes the characters clipping through objects, as well as themselves.</p>
				
				<p>Also, due to the rigging, the characters may sometimes distort during certain animations.</p>
