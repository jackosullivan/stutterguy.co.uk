                <p>Let’s see if you got any lawsuits.</p>

                <p>This bundle contains 4 CAS items for adults:</p>        
				
				<ul>
					<li>One set of hat and ears (found in hats)</li>
					<li>One nose (found in glasses)</li>
					<li>One suit jacket with hands (found in top half)</li>
					<li>One set of shoes (found in shoes)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The hat can be used with hair, however some hairs may clip through the hat. Also, the nose should move and scale with your sims nose, but there may be some noses that are just a little too big to be used with the CC nose, so just scale them down a bit.</p>
				
				<p>To download the bundle, click the link below.</p>

				<p>Some people have been having difficulty using Helpy’s jacket. For the time being, I’ve created a gloveless version to see if this helps.</p>
