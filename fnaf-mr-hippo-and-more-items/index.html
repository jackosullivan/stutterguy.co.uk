                <p>I’ve added these downloads separately as not everyone wants both items.</p>

				<h4>Mr Hippo</h4>    
				
				<p>Mr Hippo’s clothes are a full body piece, and his ears and hat can be found in the hat section.  Whilst his hat works with most hairs, it may clip through others.</p>

				<h4>Arcade & Ball Pit</h4>    
				
				<p>The arcade machine has two swatches, and the price is the average of the two machines from Pizzeria Simulator.  The ball pit may need resizing if you are planning on having it a suitable size for you sims. Both items are purely decorative and cannot be played with.</p>
