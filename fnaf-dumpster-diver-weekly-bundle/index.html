                <p>Your business has to start somewhere.</p>

                <p>This bundle contains:</p>     
				
				<ul>
					<li>Balloon Barrel</li>
					<li>Bucket Bob</li>
					<li>Cups and Plates</li>
					<li>Fiztime Pop Soda Sponsorship</li>
					<li>Mr Can-Do</li>
					<li>Pan Stan</li>
					<li>Paper Pals</li>
					<li>Sanitation Station Shelf</li>
					<li>Sanitation Station Mop & Bucket</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>All items are priced roughly around what they’d cost in the original game. Because the sanitation station was split in two, they both cost half of the original price, and the plates have been split into a fraction of their price.</p>

				<h4>**There is currently an issue with this CC. If you are able to run the Sims with high graphics settings, most of the CC appears transparent. This is an issue that I am currently working on. If you have already downloaded this content and don’t have this issue, then you do not need to worry. There should be no other issues with this CC. If you do find an issue, please report it to StutterGuy on Twitter. Happy simming!**</h4>
