                <p>The red writing appeared on the screen again, only it was dripping, like blood and it was crooked. “Sonic, my love…”</p>

                <p>This CC pack contains two items, an head which is found in hats, and a body which is found in the full body clothing category. At the moment, the full body item does not work with shoes as the texture overlaps, however you can simply make her barefoot or use clothes from the game as she’s a fairly simple character.</p>
